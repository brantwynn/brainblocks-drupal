# brainblocks-drupal
XRB payment gateway for Drupal using brainblocks.io

Here's a quick block with some global configuration. After installing the module, either embed the block *somewhere* or add your own element tagged as #brainblocks-block

# Don't forget to confgure the form
Visit /admin/commerce/brainblocks to edit the form and put in your recieving address. There is a working wallet for test purposes listed in default config.

# You can change the form from rai to other currency...

...such as USD, this will show the conversion rate on the block. You will still be requesting rai from the form. This is just for reference and ease of use.

# Amount will act accordingly

Be careful with your form and using the permissions on this module. Please make sure your Drupal sites are secure.
